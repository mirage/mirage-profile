description: """
This library can be used to trace execution of OCaml/Lwt programs (such as
Mirage unikernels) at the level of Lwt threads.  The traces can be viewed using
JavaScript or GTK viewers provided by [mirage-trace-viewer][] or processed by
tools supporting the [Common Trace Format (CTF)][ctf].

This backend adds a Unix collector.
